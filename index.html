  <h2 class="contentHeading">About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a software developer with a Computer Science Engineering degree from Ohio State University. I graduated in 2008, but have been playing with code ever since I was young. I view code as a brain teaser puzzle and find it very rewarding to figure something out. Learning new ways of doing things keeps me very excited and interested in programming. I write code because it is my passion and am lucky that it is also my career.</p>
  <p>Besides writing code, one of my biggest passions is cycling. I love mountain biking, road biking, bike maintenance, and generally anything with wheels. I also have many other hobbies including photography, anything outdoors, and any do-it-yourself projects.</p>
