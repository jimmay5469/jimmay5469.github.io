As an avid biker I absolutely love my new toy: a [Wahoo Kickr Snap](http://www.wahoofitness.com/devices/kickr-snap-bike-trainer) and [Zwift](http://zwift.com/). For once I'm not completely dreading a winter filled with no rides!

More about that later, but for now... you've got all the same sweet toys, you've done a sweet ride, and then you never get your notification from [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) that your ride got uploaded. What a bummer, you were excited to check out your ride data, compare it to other rides you and your friends have done, check it out on [VeloViewer](https://veloviewer.com), and bump up that milage for the year.

## Recovering the FIT file

Luckily, theres actually a pretty good chance you will be able to recover that awesome ride. What you'll need: your iPhone/iPad which you used for the ride, your computer, a lightning cable, and [iFunBox](http://www.i-funbox.com/en_download.html). Once you get everything connected and iFunBox installed here's all you have to do:

There is also a chance the ride may be uploaded to the Zwift website for you to download, but sometimes they are partial rides and the full ride can be found in iFunBox.

## Uploading to Strava

Getting the `.fit` file was the hard part, now just go to the Strava [upload page](https://www.strava.com/upload/select), upload the recovered `.fit` file, and make sure to select `Virtual Ride` as the activity type. You won't get a cool photo upload from Zwift like you normally do but everything else will be just like normal!
