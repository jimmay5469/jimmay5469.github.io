### Developer

#### [Gaslight](https://teamgaslight.com/)

_March 2017 - Present_

Gaslight is a consulting company which is highly respected within the Cincinnati development community. We are known for our community envolvement, code quality, UX quality, and agile software development practices. We value small mighty teams so most of our projects consist of 2 developers that pair program and a UX designer. Some of the projects I have worked on have been:

- An open source blockchain explorer written for Etherium-based blockchains. It is written mostly on Elixir and Phoenix but also utilizes Redux to manage state and realtime socket data on the front-end. This project was a collaboration between a few well known consulting companies in the indurstry and even included the original author of Elixir and the original author of Phoenix. I was Gaslight's team lead on the project of 2 Gaslight UX designers and 3 Gaslight developers.
- A GIS app for the lawn and landscaping industry which allows companies to take complex measurements for jobs on a map. They use this data do project estimation and planning. This is a huge help for them because they are able to accurately take measurements without the cost of traveling to the actual location, as well as to have a much more visual tool that they can use and reflect back on. It has a Rails back-end and a React/Redux front-end and makes heavy use of the Esri JavaScript library.
- A data visualization app to display and organize lab results for testing done on consumer product materials. It is a single page app utilizing Python, GraphQL, and React/Redux.


### Software Engineer

#### [Ahalogy](https://www.ahalogy.com/)

_March 2014 - March 2017_

Ahalogy is a social marketing startup which specializes in bringing content creators and big brands together to help each other win on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/). As a front-end JavaScript developer at Ahalogy I was responsible for developing and maintaining an Ember.js application which allows users to effectively maintain and measure performance on their Pinterest account. My activities included:

- Leading project planning and project upgrading for a team of 2-3 remote Ember developers.
- Leading release management for our 2 main Ember projects and 1 Ember addon used for shared code between the projects. [Semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) is used for project versioning and the [ember-cli-deploy](http://ember-cli.com/ember-cli-deploy/) lightning strategy is used in our automated deployments.
- Managing development and peer reviews using Git and GitHub. The [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model is used and work is completed in forks of the Ahalogy repository.
- Establishing a [scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) process as a tool for managing iterative development on our team.
- Establishing a culture of acceptance, integration, and unit testing within our Ember applications.
- Leading development on both application security and Pinterest authentication using OAuth.
- Pair programming remotely with team members using Screenhero and other tools.


### Sr. Application Developer

#### [Great American Financial Resources](http://www.greatamericaninsurancegroup.com/Annuities/)

_July 2013 - March 2014_

As an experienced full-stack [ASP.Net MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc) developer at Great American Financial Resources I was responsible for maintaining a set of applications which were used by internal and external salespeople who sell annuities for Great American. My activities included:

- Building an extensive set of automated regression tests to ensure quality as new features were developed and deployed.
- Getting more familiar with and working under the scrum process.
- Mentoring many less experienced peers and interns.
- Building and sharing knowledge with my team about newer JavaScript technologies which could improve our applications.


### Application Developer

#### [Time Warner Cable](http://www.timewarnercable.com/)

_April 2010 - June 2013_

As a full-stack ASP.Net developer at Time Warner Cable I worked on many internal applications to help the business and our development team run more smoothly. Some of these applications included:

- A security management application which was used as a centralized interface for role management for many of our internal applications.
- An API management application which was used to manage registration to many of our internal APIs.
- An iPad application to aid door-to-door salespeople. It placed planned destinations on a map which were then selectable to view more information about the address and allow the salesperson to keep notes and mark the location as visited.
- An application which was able to create dynamic web forms in order to remove the need for a developer when creating one-off custom form applications that were very common.
