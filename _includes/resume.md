Summary
-------

I am an engineering manager and software engineer who grew up programming websites for fun as a child and who now has a computer science degree and nearly 20 years of professional experience.

I have always been a natural leader so even before taking on engineering manager roles I always gravitated towards leading the teams I have been on. I am very empathetic towards the end-users of my products and take a special interest in UX, working very closely with the designers on teams I have been part of to create the best user experience possible.

I look forward to seeing what I get to help create in my next role!

- Lead front-end web development using Next.js, React/Redux, and Typescript.
- Establish our front-end development and release process.

### Senior Software Engineer

#### [Chegg](https://www.chegg.com/)

_August 2019 - September 2022_

Chegg originally made its name in the college space by providing online textbook rentals and quickly became the main online resource for college students providing services like Q&A, and homework help. During my time there I worked on two different teams, the team responsible for building and maintaining Internships.com, and the team responsible for building and maintaining Thinkful, Chegg's online bootcamp. My activities included:

- Greatly improve the SEO capabilities of Internships.com and ease of maintaining our SEO-related code. As part of this project, I had to:
  - Convert our React codebase to Next.js without interrupting the development of other features as well as transitioning other features over from WordPress.
  - Update our Docker images and CI processes to release the Next.js solution alongside the existing solutions.
  - Work with the DevOps team to transition traffic from the old solutions to the Next.js solution.
- Build and maintain features for Internships.com using React/Redux.
- Lead Thinkful's transition from React to Next.js modeling off of the Internships.com work.
- Build and maintain features for Thinkful using React/Redux.
- Lead many efforts to improve code quality at Thinkful because the original code had been rapidly developed while they were a startup and was not up to Chegg standards.

### Project Lead & Developer

#### [Launch Scout](https://launchscout.com/)

_March 2017 - August 2019_

Launch Scout (formerly Gaslight) is a consulting company that is highly respected within the Cincinnati development community. They are known for their community involvement, code quality, UX quality, and agile software development practices. They value small mighty teams so most of our projects consist of 2 developers that pair program and a UX designer. Some of the projects I worked on there were:

- An open source blockchain explorer written for Etherium-based blockchains. It is written mostly on Elixir and Phoenix but also utilizes Redux to manage state and real-time socket data on the front-end. This project was a collaboration between a few well-known consulting companies in the industry and even included the original author of Elixir and the original author of Phoenix. I was Launch Scout's team lead on the project of 2 Launch Scout UX designers and 3 Launch Scout developers.
- A GIS app for the lawn and landscaping industry that allows companies to take complex measurements for jobs on a map. They use this data to do project estimation and planning. This is a huge help for them because they can accurately take measurements without the cost of traveling to the actual location, as well as have a much more visual tool that they can use and reflect on. It has a Rails back-end and a React/Redux front-end and makes heavy use of the Esri JavaScript library.
- A data visualization app to display and organize lab results for testing done on consumer product materials. It is a single-page app utilizing Python, GraphQL, and React/Redux.

#### [Ahalogy](https://www.ahalogy.com/)

_March 2014 - March 2017_

Ahalogy is a social marketing startup that specializes in bringing content creators and big brands together to help each other win on Pinterest. As a front-end JavaScript developer at Ahalogy, I was responsible for developing and maintaining an Ember.js application that allows users to effectively maintain and measure performance on their Pinterest accounts. My activities included:

- Lead project planning and project upgrading for a team of 2-3 remote Ember developers.
- Lead release management for our 2 main Ember projects and 1 Ember addon used for shared code between the projects. Semantic versioning is used for project versioning and the ember-cli-deploy lightning strategy is used in our automated deployments.
- Manage development and peer reviews using Git and GitHub. The git-flow branching model is used and work is completed in forks of the Ahalogy repository.
- Establish a scrum process as a tool for managing iterative development on our team.
- Establish a culture of acceptance, integration, and unit testing within our Ember applications.
- Lead development on both application security and Pinterest authentication using OAuth.
- Pair program remotely with team members using Screenhero and other tools.
