Summary
-------

I am a passionate software developer with experience in both front-end JavaScript and full-stack development. Most recently, I have been doing front-end development using [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/). I am a natural leader and I constantly push myself to learn and share what I have learned with others. I also have a strong interest in usability and work closely with designers to create an intuitive user experience. I highly value meetups and make a point to present topics in addition to my regular attendance.

I am currently interested in both front-end and full-stack opportunities using JavaScript frameworks such as Ember.js or React.js and server technologies such as Elixir, Ruby, and Node.js. I am also interested in more unique opportunities such as library or framework development, embedded code, and mobile development. Open source is a plus.

Ahalogy is a social marketing startup which specializes in bringing content creators and big brands together to help each other win on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/). As a front-end JavaScript developer at Ahalogy I am responsible for developing and maintaining an Ember.js application which allows users to effectively maintain and measure performance on their Pinterest account.

[Semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) is used for project versioning and the [ember-cli-deploy](http://ember-cli.com/ember-cli-deploy/) lightning strategy is used in our automated deployments.
- Managing development and peer reviews using Git and GitHub. The  [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model is used and work is completed in forks of the Ahalogy repository.
- Establishing a [scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) process as a tool for managing iterative development on our team.

### Sr. Application Developer

#### [Great American Financial Resources](http://www.greatamericaninsurancegroup.com/Annuities/)

_July 2013 - March 2014_

As an experienced full-stack [ASP.Net MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc) developer at Great American Financial Resources I was responsible for maintaining a set of applications which were used by internal and external salespeople who sell annuities for Great American. My activities included:

- Building an extensive set of automated regression tests to ensure quality as new features were developed and deployed.
- Getting more familiar with and working under the scrum process.
- Mentoring many less experienced peers and interns.
- Building and sharing knowledge with my team about newer JavaScript technologies which could improve our applications.


### Application Developer

#### [Time Warner Cable](http://www.timewarnercable.com/)

_April 2010 - June 2013_

As a full-stack ASP.Net developer at Time Warner Cable I worked on many internal applications to help the business and our development team run more smoothly. Some of these applications included:

- A security management application which was used as a centralized interface for role management for many of our internal applications.
- An API management application which was used to manage registration to many of our internal APIs.
- An iPad application to aid door-to-door salespeople. It placed planned destinations on a map which were then selectable to view more information about the address and allow the salesperson to keep notes and mark the location as visited.
- An application which was able to create dynamic web forms in order to remove the need for a developer when creating one-off custom form applications that were very common.
