Summary
-------

I am an engineering manager, a leader, and someone who gets great joy from teaching and helping other engineers.

I am an agile enthusiast who loves actively breaking down work into its smallest pieces and continually prioritizing them, finding ways to deliver features and products to users sooner, gathering feedback, and iterating.

I advocate for iterative approaches to maintaining and upgrading legacy systems rather than rewriting.

I place heavy emphasis on user experience, always working very closely with designers to design and create the best experience for users.

I look forward to seeing what I get to help create and who I can help to progress in their careers in my next role!
